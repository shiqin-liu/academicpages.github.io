I am a PhD Candidate in the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs at Northeastern University. My current research focuses on regional economic analysis and spatial analytics of urban indicators. My dissertation research examines the spatial pattern of entrepreneurial activities across the urban-rural spectrum and the impacts of environmental factors on new business formation and regional development in U.S. cities. In addition, I am working on assessing [pedestrain accessibility indicators](https://github.com/shiqin-liu/global-indicators) employing open-source data and reproducible data science methods, which could be used to benchmark, monitor and assess the potential of cities to promote health and wellbeing in a global context. 

I am an experienced research assistant with a demonstrated history of working in the higher education industry. I am skilled in R, Python, Stata, and quantitative research. I am also a genuine supporter of diversity and inclusion in achieving academic excellence and global engagement.  I previously served on a diversity advisory council and administrative team at the [Civic, Sustainability, and Diversity Initiative](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/csdi/) of the College of Social Sciences and Humanities (CSSH) at Northeastern.
